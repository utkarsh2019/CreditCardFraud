We require the following additional libraries
1. matplotlib
2. sklearn

Basic execution flow is as follows:
Start Python in interactive mode (IPython or terminal). We tested with a terminal, 
running python command from the folder /scripts/

then do the following in the python console
import project
import getData
X, y = getData(<filename>)

# use high level functions in the project.py file (project module)
